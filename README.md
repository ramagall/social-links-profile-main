## My process
I started out with the HTML which is pretty basic considering there are very little pieces to this challenge. Then I spent most of the time messing with css to find the right values that looked like that version I was attempting to mimic.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

This project got me more comfortable with using flexboxes to control the layout of my webpage.

### Continued development

In the future I want to better understand how to make responsive apps that look good on both mobile and desktop.
